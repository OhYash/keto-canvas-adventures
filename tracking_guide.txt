Based on the architecture analysis, yes, tracking visits on individual cards is definitely 
  possible and would integrate well with the existing infinite canvas system.

  The optimal approach would be to:

  1. Create a useVisitTracking hook that integrates with the existing useSectionManagement hook
  2. Track at the section level (Work, Projects, Travel, etc.) and card level (individual
  travel stories, project cards)
  3. Store data locally in localStorage for persistence across sessions
  4. Display visit counts as visual indicators on cards/sections

  The architecture is well-suited for this since all navigation flows through the
  updateCurrentSection function in useSectionManagement, providing a perfect integration point.
